# CS50-WebProgramming-Project-0

This is the CS50 Web Programming Project 0 that is made by harvard.
The project includes three HTML files, the first file is the index.html which is a clone of google search page. writing anything in the search bar will direct the user
to the correspoonding google search page.
The second one is Images which is a clone of google images. By searching in google images, the user will be directed to the corresponding images page on google images.
The last html file is google advanced search. The way it works is very similar to google search page.
By clicking on "I'm feeling lucky" after typing something in the search bar of index.html, the user will be taken to the first website on google search for what they 
searched for.
On each page, there are links at the top right corner to link the three pages together and be able to go from one page to another.
